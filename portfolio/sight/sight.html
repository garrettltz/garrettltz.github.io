<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Sight was created for the 2017 Global Game Jam, The objective of the game was to escort the old blind outside of his house and away from the fire in his house. Using sounds that were playing around the house would help the players figure out the proper way to get from room to room. The player could also make their own sounds using things that they find along the way through the house in order to see. </h1>
